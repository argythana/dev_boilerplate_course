# Lecture 3 Python: functions, modular development, project structure, dev tools.

Get first basic understanding of the following:

### 1. Define functions:
* Do one thing only. Using *"and"* is **smelly code**.
* Naming concepts:  
    * Function name.
    * Variable name.
    * Argument name.
    * Return name.
* Arguments and Parameters.
* Type Hints
* Doc strings
* Return
* Call other functions in a function.

### 2. Modular development: User-made python "modules".
* different file to define useful functions.
* module docstring.
* the `__name__` variable.
* the `__main__` variable.
* the `__int__.py` python file.
* different file to run a project script.
* Usage of: `if __name__ == "__main__":` statement.

### 3. Project structure: use relative paths and dedicated folders.
* for data input files.
* to run main script.

### 5. Examples with basic usage of `streamlit`.
* sliders
* charts.
* update code.
* update users view.


## How to practice:
1) Use a new jupyter notebook to:    
a) sum activities distance by date.  
b) Create a plotly chart for this.  
c) Create a streamlit app for this chart.  
Do this, cell after cell, in many single line commands.    

2) Define new different functions to do all this in a new `.py` file.  
And in the end, define a function that calls all these functions and creates the streamlit app.  

3) Create a different file to run and create the streamlit app in few lines of code.  
4) Push to GitHub, in a branch with your name, all the files you created.
