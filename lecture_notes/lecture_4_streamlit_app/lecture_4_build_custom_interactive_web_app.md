# Lecture 4 Custom python interactive App.


### Examples with basic usage of `streamlit`.
* sliders
* charts.
* update code.
* update users view.

Read the [streamlit cheatsheet](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/cheatsheet) for more examples.

Use the files in the src folder:  
`create_dashboard_functions.py`  
`create_dashboard.py`


## How to practice:
1) Use a new jupyter notebook to:    
a) sum activities distance by date.  
b) Create a plotly chart for this.  
c) Create a streamlit app for this chart.  
Do this, cell after cell, in many single line commands.    

2) Define new different functions to do all this in a new `.py` file.  
And in the end, define a function that calls all these functions and creates the streamlit app.  

3) Create a different file to run and create the streamlit app in few lines of code.  
4) Push to GitHub, in a branch with your name, all the files you created.
