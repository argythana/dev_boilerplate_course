A file to mess around, play and learn.

Your first exercise for this course is:   

Add your Name, GitHub username and hackers nickname separated with commas.

Do this from your personal branch, on your local PC fork of the course repository.
Then do a pull request so that I merge it in the main branch of the GitHub repository.

It's ok if it is difficult, if or you cannot do it.
You have credits for "30 minutes free help" (/jk), so that I could help you do it.
In any case, this is what we will revise in the first 15 minutes of the next lecture.


Examples:
=======

Name, GitHub username, hackers nickname

Thanasis Argyriou, argythana, white_hat_cat
Argyriou Thanasis, argythana, data_dogo
Boring Teacher, boringteacher, please_don't_fall_asleep_during_class
