# Lecture 7: Asynchronous education (optional, self-paced): SQL tools

Working on Relational (SQL) Databases with Python. Training on real data and tasks examples.  

Use an SQL database with the same data to create a streamlit app.
Class Resources:
1) [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
SQl Alchemy is a Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM).   
It gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
2) [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, full-featured, SQL database engine.
3) [SQLite Python Driver](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
The sqlite3 module provides a SQL interface to communicate with SQLite databases.
4) [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development.
5) [PostgreSQL Python Driver](https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/)
Psycopg is the most popular PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language.   
6) Its main features are the complete implementation of the Python DB API 2.0 specification and the thread safety (several threads can share the same connection). It was designed for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs. The psycopg3 package is a complete rewrite of the psycopg2 driver.    
6) It is built on top of the new PostgreSQL libpq async API and requires Python 3.7+.
