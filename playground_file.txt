A file to mess around and play.

Your first exercise for this course is:   

Add your nickname next to your email after a comma.   
Do this from your personal branch, on your local PC fork of the course repository.
Then do a pull request so that I merge it in the main branch of the GitHub repository.

It's ok if it is difficult, if or you cannot do it.
You have a special offer for 30 minutes free private class, so that I could help you do it.
In any case, this is what we will do in the first 30 minutes of the next lecture.
